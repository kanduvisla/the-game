The Game
========

An Open-Source, Community-Driven Game

## what is this?

the-game is an idea I had for a while now. The idea is to create a game from scratch, driven by ideas and input of the
open source community

## the rules

There are a 3 main rules:

1. **No Profit**<br /> - The game will always be free. Free to play, and not freemium. No ads, no content that you can buy. Nothing of all that.
2. **Browser-based**<br /> - The game will run in the browser, without the use of any plugins. The main browser to aim here is Chrome.
3. **No Plan**<br /> - The whole idea is that there is no exact plan where the game is going. All ideas are welcome on where to go from here.
